# modul-components
A set of VueJS components for Modul web applications.

## Usage
1. Clone this project
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm run dev

> The `npm run build` command produces multiple .js files (Webpack multiple entry points) along with their definition files (.d.ts). This might be changed in a near future to benefit of the Webpack treeshaking feature.
