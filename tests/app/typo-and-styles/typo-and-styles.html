            <p><em>Sandra Nitchi is a musician and an artist</em> and in the midst of completing her first novel. She is torn between pursuing a career as an aeronautical engineer or an actress, or maybe even an urban designer or a politician.</p>
            <p>She’ll probably end up doing all four.</p>
            <p>Sandra is all of 11 years old, and to label her simply as an over-achiever is to dramatically understate.<br />Sandra is also the only Montrealer to be competing on the first season of Canada’s Smartest Person Junior, a six-week series that debuts Wednesday at 8 p.m. on CBC-TV. Nearly 1,000 Canadian kids, between 9 and 12, applied for the competition, and Sandra made it as one the Top 12 finalists.<br />On the surface, Sandra, with her braided pigtails and boundless energy, could pass for any 11-year-old. A sixth-grade student at Des amis-du-monde in Côte-St-Luc — not far from her home — the fluently bilingual Sandra is, no surprise, a math whiz, too. She is also a Girl Guide, which is how she got wind of Canada’s Smartest Person Junior.</p>
